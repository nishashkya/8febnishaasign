    "example : Suppose you want to create a banking application and you are asked to collect all the information about your customer. there are some chances that you will end up with some unnecessary informatin\n",

    "The features mentioned above are functionalities of most of the smartphone. However, you don’t need to understand the internal functioning details of those features before using this program. \n",
    "Example, you don’t need to know how your camera calculates gamma correction or identifies a human face in an image. You just need to learn the software interface. This is encapsulation.\n"
